A handheld gaming platform for the visually impaired.

Imagine a handheld device that senses movement and let's you synthesize music, play virtual reality games, control other devices with gestures, and best of all, it is completely open and programmable! Without the need for a computer, GesturePi connects to your WiFi and acts as a website where you can choose what do you want to do with it. You can choose from already programmed apps like a drum set, a theremin, and a gesture detector, or you can easily connect a monitor and keyboard and mouse to the Raspberry Pi and make new apps yourself! This hack is designed to be a platform using which everyone can create new apps, games, and music!
